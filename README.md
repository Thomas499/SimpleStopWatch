# SimpleStopWatch
This is very simple stopwatch app for Android using Kotlin.

This application contains only one screen.
Only **inbuilt** Java tools, Android components and Kotlin. **No one additional library**.

This should contains architecture, but don't see any right way to separate them (MVP or MVVM) cause all parts (excluding only TimeUtil) is Android depending code.
