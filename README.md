# SimpleStopWatch
This is very simple stopwatch app for Android using Kotlin.

This application contains only one screen.
Only inbuilt Android tools and components. No one additional library.

This should contains architecture, but don't see any right way to separate them (MVP or MVVM) cause all parts (excluding only TimeUtil) is Android depending code.
